IN PROGRESS:

SMALL:
- includes/codes.php: Write function to send emails
- new: More information in emails (who is the user, what is the email about, what website is the email from)
- includes/account.php: Click here to create a new wishlist!

MEDIUM:
- Add default and custom config files for DB.php to use
- Rework page titles
- Make errors prettier
- Add user page (public profile)
- Form validation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#server-side)
- Rework location display in navbar
- After X attempts at logging in, wait Y seconds before you can retry logging in to prevent spamming
- Restrict access to certain pages (for example, all /includes/ pages)

BIG:
- Redo portal (https://andwecode.com/create-popup-login-and-signup-form/#live)
- Routes (clean URL)
- Create list from homepage without having to log in/register, enter email address later to register account

IDEA:
- Guest accounts (don't need to log in to visit list and claim item/system automatically creates an account for current session, user can enter email later)
- Night mode (https://bootswatch.com/darkly/)
- Hover over time since to show exact date/time
- Invite users for lists
- Take a look at session_regenerate_id (https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.session-regenerate-id.php)
- Add/enable HTTPS (research how it works first xD )
- In user settings, toggle between "Last post in forum" and "Last unread post in forum" or maybe even "Last unread post in tracked topics" (maybe even toggle per category and/or per forum)

DONE:
- account.php: Add links to displayed lists
- Add Iconic library to the site
- list.php: Display a list and its items
- new_list.php: Add functionality for users to create new wishlists
- includes/codes: Rework location to display URLs word for word. Example: new_list.php is displayed as New_list, rather than New List
- includes/account.php: Add button to create new wishlists
- includes/account.php: Add headers to describe what info is being displayed
- includes/account.php: Display all lists owned by user
- includes/account.php: Display all lists/items that user contributes to
